    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n- Removed error message for when XR Simulation Environments package sample is not found upon installing sample environments, and replaced it with a warning instructing how to import the sample.\n\n- Use version 1.0.0-pre.2 of *XR Simulation Environments* package installed through the AR Environment toolbar. This version adds documentation and an explicit dependency on AR Foundation.\n\n- Temporary scenes generated for XR Environment Simulation now have a uniquely generated hash appended to their names to prevent loading errors when restarting a simulated AR Session.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed an issue where `ARBackgroundRendererFeature` would overwrite rendered geometry when rendering in `AfterOpaques` mode while Occlusion was enabled.\n- Fixed an issue where the DefaultSimulationEnvironment would not render correctly when using the Universal Render Pipeline.\n- Fixed error in the AR Environment Overlay if the XR General Settings asset was not created before opening the overlay.\n- Fixed binding error in the AR Environment Overlay when enabling/disabling multiple Plug-in Providers in XR Plug-in Management.\n- Fixed issue in [Simulation Raycast Subsystem](xref:UnityEngine.XR.Simulation.SimulationRaycastSubsystem) where empty arrays were causing out of bounds exceptions.\n- Fixed simulation material inspectors so values correctly update from the inspector to the material.\n- Fixed hard crash from simulation mesh subsystem upon quickly entering and exiting play mode.\n- Fixed simulated image tracking subsystem checking for occlusion of images from the camera.\n- Fixed error loading AR Environment icon when AR Foundation is first added to a project.\n- Fixed crash in `RenderSettings` that was preventing the `SimulationRenderSettings` from being used in the AR Environment View in Unity 2022.1+.\n- Fixed issues where AR Environment Overlay would not be restored or display correctly in a Scene View."
